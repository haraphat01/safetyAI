# Safety Zones Feature

## Overview

The Safety Zones feature provides users with real-time information about nearby emergency services and important locations. This feature helps users quickly find police stations, hospitals, fire stations, embassies, pharmacies, and other safety-related establishments in their vicinity. The feature is accessible through the Quick Actions menu on the home screen for easy access during emergencies.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Location Detection**: Uses device GPS to determine user's current location
- **Nearby Safety Zones**: Displays emergency services within a configurable radius (1km to 25km)
- **Multiple Zone Types**: Supports various types of safety zones:
  - Police Stations
  - Hospitals
  - Fire Stations
  - Embassies
  - Pharmacies
  - Urgent Care Centers
  - Gas Stations
  - ATMs
  - Hotels
  - Restaurants

### User Interface
- **Filter System**: Users can filter by zone type, distance, and open/closed status
- **Distance Display**: Shows exact distance to each safety zone
- **Rating System**: Displays user ratings when available
- **Open/Closed Status**: Indicates if establishments are currently open
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to directions and emergency calls

### Interactive Features
- **Get Directions**: Opens Google Maps with directions to selected safety zone
- **Emergency Calls**: Quick access to call emergency services or the establishment
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Update safety zones list with current location
- **Haptic Feedback**: Provides tactile feedback for better user experience

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Service Layer**: `SafetyZonesService` handles API calls and data processing
- **Custom Hook**: `useSafetyZones` manages state and business logic
- **Components**: Modular components for cards, filters, and screens
- **Location Integration**: Uses existing `LocationService` for GPS functionality

### API Integration
- **Google Places API**: Primary data source for safety zone information
- **Fallback System**: Mock data when API is unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Data Flow
1. User opens Safety Zones tab
2. App requests location permission
3. Current location is obtained
4. Google Places API is queried for nearby establishments
5. Results are filtered and displayed
6. User can interact with individual safety zones

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Google Places API Key**: Required for real safety zone data
2. **Location Permissions**: Must be enabled in app settings
3. **Internet Connection**: Required for API calls

### Environment Variables
Add the following to your environment configuration:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key_here
```

### Google Places API Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Places API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Restrict the API key to your app's bundle identifier
6. Add the key to your environment variables

### Location Permissions
The app automatically requests location permissions when the Safety Zones feature is accessed. Users can:
- Grant permission for immediate access
- Deny permission and be prompted to enable in settings
- Use the feature with limited functionality (mock data)

## Usage Guide

### Accessing Safety Zones
1. Open the SafetyAI app
2. On the home screen, tap the "Safety Zones" button in the Quick Actions menu
3. Grant location permission if prompted
4. View nearby safety zones

### Filtering Results
1. Tap the "Filters" button
2. Select desired zone types
3. Choose maximum distance
4. Toggle "Open Now Only" if needed
5. Apply filters

### Interacting with Safety Zones
1. **View Details**: Tap on any safety zone card
2. **Get Directions**: Tap "Directions" button to open Google Maps
3. **Make Call**: Tap "Call" button for emergency services
4. **Refresh**: Pull down to update the list

### Emergency Features
- **Quick Call**: Direct access to 911 or establishment phone numbers
- **Directions**: One-tap navigation to safety zones
- **Distance Info**: Real-time distance calculations
- **Status Updates**: Current open/closed status

## Mock Data

When the Google Places API is unavailable, the app provides mock data for testing and development:

### Mock Safety Zones
- Central Police Station (500m)
- City General Hospital (1.2km)
- Downtown Fire Station (800m)
- Canadian Embassy (2km)
- 24/7 Pharmacy (1.5km)

### Mock Data Features
- Realistic distances and addresses
- Sample ratings and open/closed status
- Functional direction and call buttons
- Complete UI testing capabilities

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Location Permission Denied**
   - Shows permission request screen
   - Provides guidance to enable in settings

2. **API Key Missing**
   - Falls back to mock data
   - Logs warning message

3. **Network Errors**
   - Displays error message
   - Offers retry option
   - Falls back to cached data if available

4. **No Safety Zones Found**
   - Shows empty state with suggestions
   - Provides option to expand search radius

### User Feedback
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Error messages with actionable solutions
- Success confirmations for user actions
- Haptic feedback for interactions

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- **Caching**: Safety zone data is cached locally
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Debounced Updates**: Location updates are throttled
- **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filtering for responsiveness

### Battery Usage
- **Location Updates**: Optimized for minimal battery impact
- **API Calls**: Limited to necessary requests
- **Background Processing**: Minimal background activity

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Location Data**: Only used for safety zone queries
- **API Keys**: Securely stored in environment variables
- **User Privacy**: No location data is stored or transmitted unnecessarily

### Permissions
- **Location Access**: Required for core functionality
- **Network Access**: Required for API calls
- **Phone Access**: Optional for emergency calls

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Offline Mode**: Cached safety zones for offline access
- **Custom Safety Zones**: User-defined safe locations
- **Route Planning**: Multi-stop safety zone navigation
- **Emergency Contacts**: Integration with existing contact system
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates for safety zones

### Potential Integrations
- **Emergency Services**: Direct integration with local emergency systems
- **Public Safety APIs**: Real-time incident reporting
- **Community Features**: User-submitted safety information
- **AI Integration**: Smart recommendations based on context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems
1. **No Safety Zones Showing**
   - Check location permissions
   - Verify internet connection
   - Try expanding search radius

2. **Directions Not Working**
   - Ensure Google Maps is installed
