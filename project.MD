# Product Requirements Document (PRD): SafeGuard AI Safety App (Expo)


## 1. Overview
**Product Vision**: SafeGuard is a cross-platform (iOS/Android) mobile app built with Expo, delivering AI-driven personal safety through real-time threat detection and instant emergency response. Powered by Supabase for secure backend services, it offers a freemium model with core safety features free and premium features via subscription.

**Problem Statement**: Urban users need discreet, proactive safety tools for risky environments. Existing apps lack Expoâ€™s cross-platform efficiency, robust AI integration, or strong privacy protections.

**Objectives**:
- Launch MVP by October 23, 2025, targeting 10,000 active users in 6 months.
- Achieve 4.5+ app store rating, 60% retention, and $50,000 MRR in 12 months.
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA/SOC 2 compliance using Expo and Supabase.

**Success Metrics**:
- 70% MAU of downloads, <2s threat alert latency, <1s SOS dispatch.
- 90% user satisfaction with emergency features (in-app surveys).
- 20% free-to-premium conversion rate.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Primary Persona**: Sarah, 28, urban professional needing discreet safety alerts.
