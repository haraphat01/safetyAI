# AI-Powered Safety Features

This document describes the AI-powered features implemented in the SafetyAI app using OpenAI integration.

## Overview

The app now includes intelligent AI-powered features that provide:
- **Emergency Situation Analysis**: Real-time analysis of emergency descriptions
- **Injury Image Analysis**: Medical assessment of injury photos
- **First Aid Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for medical emergencies
- **Voice-Activated Emergency**: Voice input for hands-free emergency assistance

## Features

### 1. Emergency Situation Analysis

**Description**: Users can describe emergency situations in text or voice, and the AI provides instant analysis with severity assessment and recommended actions.

**How it works**:
- User inputs emergency description (text or voice)
- AI analyzes the situation using GPT-4o-mini
- Returns structured analysis with:
  - Severity level (low/medium/high/critical)
  - Incident type classification
  - Concise summary for responders
  - Recommended immediate actions
  - Confidence level

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "severity": "high",
  "incidentType": "Cardiac Emergency",
  "summary": "User reports chest pain and shortness of breath, consistent with potential heart attack symptoms",
  "recommendedActions": [
    "Call 911 immediately",
    "Have user sit down and rest",
    "Monitor breathing and consciousness"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

### 2. Injury Image Analysis

**Description**: Users can take photos of injuries and receive instant medical assessment and treatment recommendations.

**How it works**:
- User takes photo using device camera
- Image is analyzed using GPT-4o Vision
- AI provides:
  - List of visible injuries
  - Severity assessment (minor/moderate/severe)
  - Immediate recommendations
  - Confidence level

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "injuries": ["Deep laceration on forearm", "Bleeding wound"],
  "severity": "moderate",
  "recommendations": [
    "Apply direct pressure to stop bleeding",
    "Clean wound with sterile solution",
    "Seek medical attention for proper treatment"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.78
}
```

### 3. First Aid Guidance

**Description**: Provides step-by-step first aid instructions for various medical emergencies.

**How it works**:
- AI generates customized first aid steps based on emergency type
- Includes safety warnings and time estimates
- Clear indicators for when to call 911
- Additional medical notes

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "steps": [
    "Call 911 immediately",
    "Have the person sit down and rest",
    "Loosen any tight clothing",
    "Monitor breathing and consciousness"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Do not give food or drink",
    "Do not move the person unnecessarily"
  ],
  "estimatedTime": "5-10 minutes",
  "whenToCall911": true,
  "additionalNotes": "Keep the person calm and reassured while waiting for emergency services"
}
```

### 4. Voice-Activated Emergency

**Description**: Hands-free emergency assistance using voice commands and speech-to-text.

**Features**:
- Voice input for emergency descriptions
- Text-to-speech for AI responses
- Automatic speech for critical emergencies
- Voice feedback for analysis results

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The AI features use a secure backend architecture:

1. **Client Side**: React Native app with voice/text input
2. **Supabase Edge Function**: Secure API proxy for OpenAI calls
3. **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models
4. **Database**: Analysis results stored in Supabase

### Security

- **API Key Protection**: OpenAI API keys stored securely in Supabase environment
- **Backend Proxy**: All AI calls go through Supabase Edge Functions
- **User Authentication**: AI features require valid user session
- **Data Privacy**: No sensitive data stored in client

### Components

#### OpenAIService (`services/OpenAIService.ts`)
- Main service for AI functionality
- Handles communication with Supabase Edge Functions
- Provides type-safe interfaces for AI responses

#### EmergencyAnalysisModal (`components/EmergencyAnalysisModal.tsx`)
- Modal for emergency situation input and analysis
- Voice input simulation (can be extended with real speech-to-text)
- Displays analysis results with severity indicators
- Text-to-speech for critical emergencies

#### InjuryAnalysisModal (`components/InjuryAnalysisModal.tsx`)
- Camera integration for injury photos
- Image capture and preview
- AI analysis results display
- Medical assessment with severity levels

#### AI Assistant Screen (`app/(tabs)/ai-assistant.tsx`)
- Main interface for AI features
- Feature cards with descriptions
- Service status indicators
- Integration with analysis modals

### Supabase Edge Function (`supabase/functions/ai-analysis/index.ts`)

The Edge Function handles all OpenAI API calls securely:

```typescript
// Example usage
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('ai-analysis', {
  body: {
    type: 'emergency_analysis',
    data: {
      userDescription: 'Chest pain and shortness of breath',
      location: 'Home',
      medicalHistory: 'Diabetes'
    }
  }
});
```

**Supported Analysis Types**:
- `emergency_analysis`: Text-based emergency situation analysis
- `first_aid_guidance`: Step-by-step first aid instructions
- `vision_analysis`: Image-based injury assessment

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Add OpenAI API key to Supabase environment:
```bash
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Function

Deploy the AI analysis function:
```bash
supabase functions deploy ai-analysis
```

### 3. Client Configuration

The client automatically detects AI service availability. No additional configuration needed.

## Usage Examples

### Emergency Analysis
```typescript
import { openAIService } from '@/services/OpenAIService';

const analysis = await openAIService.analyzeEmergencySituation(
  'I think I might be having a heart attack, chest pain and shortness of breath',
  'Home - 123 Main St',
  'Diabetes, high blood pressure'
);
```

### Injury Analysis
```typescript
const analysis = await openAIService.analyzeInjuryImage(imageBase64);
```
